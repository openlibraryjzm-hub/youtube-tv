You are working on the YouTube TV desktop application. This is a Tauri v2 app (Rust backend + Next.js static export frontend) that is PRODUCTION READY and FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

CRITICAL: Read these documents in this exact order:

1. AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md - Read this COMPLETELY first. It contains:
   - Complete project overview and architecture
   - Tools, dependencies, and setup
   - How everything works fundamentally
   - The breakthrough packaging solution (_up_/ directory)
   - Build protocol and core criteria
   - Code structure and patterns
   - Critical gotchas and how to avoid them
   - Data flow and state management
   - Tauri development patterns
   - Documentation maintenance protocol

2. PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md - Optional deep dive for detailed explanations (only if you need more detail)

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- This is a Tauri app, NOT Electron (we migrated from Electron)
- Uses SQLite (rusqlite) for local database, NOT Firestore
- Next.js static export (no server), NOT standalone build
- Resources are in _up_/ directory for NSIS installers (critical discovery)
- All saves are debounced (2 seconds)
- Session-specific data uses useRef (not persisted)

WHEN MAKING CHANGES:
1. Follow existing patterns exactly
2. Use Tauri commands for all data operations
3. Debounce all saves (2 seconds)
4. ⚠️ MANDATORY: Update documentation immediately after each code change (see Documentation Maintenance Protocol below)
5. Only commit to Git when user explicitly requests it

DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE (MANDATORY - DO AS YOU GO):
- After each code change: Update affected sections in AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md immediately
  * New functions → Update "Code Structure" section
  * New state/patterns → Update "Mandatory Code Patterns" section
  * New gotchas → Update "Critical Gotchas" section
  * Architecture changes → Update "How Everything Works" section
  * Update "Last Updated" date at top of AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md
- When challenges arise: Document the problem in "Critical Gotchas" section immediately
- When challenges are solved: Mark as resolved, document solution, update "Recent Developments", update "Last Updated" date
- Key principle: Documentation should reflect current state. Update as you go, not later.

GIT WORKFLOW (ONLY WHEN USER REQUESTS):
- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Only commit when user explicitly requests it. Never automatically commit or push.

When user requests a git push:
1. Analyze all changes made since last git push (check git status, review modified/deleted/new files)
2. Update push-to-github.ps1 script's commit message with current, accurate information:
   - List all changes made
   - List all files modified/deleted/created
   - Include user's exact request in commit message
3. User then runs: .\push-to-github.ps1
4. Script stages, commits, and pushes with up-to-date information

Commit Message Format (in script):
[AI] User Request: "[exact user prompt]"

Changes:
- [List of specific changes made since last push]
- [Files modified]
- [Files deleted]
- [Files created]

Files Modified:
- [List of modified files with brief description]

Files Deleted:
- [List of deleted files]

Files Created:
- [List of new files]

GitHub Repository:
- Remote URL: https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv.git
- View commits: https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv/commits/main
- If remote not set: git remote add origin https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv.git

The app is production-ready. All critical issues have been resolved. You can confidently make changes, add features, or provide advice based on the comprehensive context in AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md.
