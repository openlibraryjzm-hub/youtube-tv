You are working on the YouTube TV desktop application. This is a Tauri v2 app (Rust backend + Next.js static export frontend) that is PRODUCTION READY and FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

CRITICAL: Read these documents in this exact order:

1. AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md - Read this COMPLETELY first. It contains:
   - Complete project overview and architecture
   - Tools, dependencies, and setup
   - How everything works fundamentally
   - The breakthrough packaging solution (_up_/ directory)
   - Build protocol and core criteria
   - Code structure and patterns
   - Critical gotchas and how to avoid them
   - Data flow and state management
   - Tauri development patterns
   - Documentation maintenance protocol

2. PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md - Optional deep dive for detailed explanations (only if you need more detail)

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- This is a Tauri app, NOT Electron (we migrated from Electron)
- Uses SQLite (rusqlite) for local database, NOT Firestore
- Next.js static export (no server), NOT standalone build
- Resources are in _up_/ directory for NSIS installers (critical discovery)
- All saves are debounced (2 seconds)
- Session-specific data uses useRef (not persisted)

WHEN MAKING CHANGES:
1. Follow existing patterns exactly
2. Use Tauri commands for all data operations
3. Debounce all saves (2 seconds)
4. ⚠️ MANDATORY: Update documentation immediately after each code change (see Documentation Maintenance Protocol below)
5. Only commit to Git when user explicitly requests it

DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE (MANDATORY - DO AS YOU GO):
- After each code change: Update affected sections in AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md immediately
  * New functions → Update "Code Structure" section
  * New state/patterns → Update "Mandatory Code Patterns" section
  * New gotchas → Update "Critical Gotchas" section
  * Architecture changes → Update "How Everything Works" section
  * Update "Last Updated" date at top of AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md
- When challenges arise: Document the problem in "Critical Gotchas" section immediately
- When challenges are solved: Mark as resolved, document solution, update "Recent Developments", update "Last Updated" date
- Key principle: Documentation should reflect current state. Update as you go, not later.

GIT WORKFLOW (ONLY WHEN USER REQUESTS):
- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Only commit when user explicitly requests it. Never automatically commit or push.
- When user requests commit/push, use this EXACT format:

[AI] User Request: "[exact user prompt]"

Changes:
- [List of specific changes made]
- [Files modified]
- [Functions added/modified]

Example:
[AI] User Request: "add bulk delete feature for playlists"

Changes:
- Added bulkDeleteMode state variable
- Implemented handleBulkDeletePlaylists() function
- Added bulk delete UI in playlists screen
- Updated AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md (patterns section)

Files Modified:
- app/page.jsx (lines 297-417: state, 214-219: functions, 4263-5166: UI)
- AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md

Commands:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "[AI] User Request: \"[exact prompt]\"\n\nChanges:\n- [list changes]"
3. git push origin main (if user requested push)

GitHub Repository:
- Remote URL: https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv.git
- View commits: https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv/commits/main
- If remote not set: git remote add origin https://github.com/openlibraryjzm-hub/youtube-tv.git

The app is production-ready. All critical issues have been resolved. You can confidently make changes, add features, or provide advice based on the comprehensive context in AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md.
