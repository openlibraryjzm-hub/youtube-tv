## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

**Minimal Documentation Approach:**
- **One master document** ([AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md](./AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md)) contains everything essential
- **Self-contained** - No need to read multiple documents
- **Well-interconnected** - All information cross-referenced within the document
- **Optional deep dives** - [PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md](./PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed explanations

**Benefits:**
- Faster onboarding (one document to read)
- Less maintenance (update one place)
- Clearer structure (everything in logical order)
- Still comprehensive (nothing important is missing)

---

## 🔗 Cross-References

All documentation is cross-referenced:
- **Within AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md:** Sections link to each other
- **To PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md:** For deep dives
- **To other docs:** For specific references when needed

**Use the links to navigate between related topics.**

---

## 📝 Maintenance

**After each code change:**
- Update [AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md](./AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md) if patterns/gotchas change
- Update [PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md](./PROJECT-MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed changes
- Update "Last Updated" dates
- Add cross-references if needed

**See:** [DOCUMENTATION-MAINTENANCE.md](./DOCUMENTATION-MAINTENANCE.md) for complete strategy

---

**Remember:** For AI agents, [AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md](./AI-ONBOARDING-PROMPT.md) is the ONLY document you need to read. It's completely self-contained and well-interconnected.
